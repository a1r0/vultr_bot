This module with API constants
I'ts for example only
VULTR_KEY - api key which you can find in hosting panel preferences
TELEGRAM_API_KEY - api key which you can get from telegram bot father
INSTANCE_ID - temporary key , which helps me to get data only from specific instance on VULTR HOSTING

Rename it in the regular vps_congig.py
